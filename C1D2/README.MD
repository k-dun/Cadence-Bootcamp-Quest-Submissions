What are the 5 Cadence Programming Language Pillars?

Safety and security, clarity, approachability, developer experience and resource oriented programming.

In your opinion, even without knowing anything about the Blockchain or coding, why could the 5 Pillars be useful (you don't have to answer this for #5)?

Safety and security is paramount due to the sensitive nature of use cases such as crypto transfers, exchange of assets etc. 
I would actually bundle up clarity and developer experience under one answer, seeing as it allows for great transparency for both users and developers, which ultimately will help the ecosystem grow. 
Approachability just means that software engineering skills gained in other stacks should be easily transferable to the development in Cadence, thus making the transition easier.
