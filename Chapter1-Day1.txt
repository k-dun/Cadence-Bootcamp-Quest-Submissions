CHAPTER 1 DAY 1
Explain what the Blockchain is in your own words.
Blockchain is a type of database, where all information is stored in blocks of data. Each block has certain capacity and once it's filled the block then closes and becomes attached at the end of the chain (hence blockchain). This allows to create a clear, linear, time-stamped record of events on the chain. Computers that take part in storing this database are called nodes. Each block once closed is attributed with a unique hash (based on its contents). Nodes are used to verify hashes against each other. If a hash isn't identical to the majority of this said hash across all nodes, it means the contents were tampered with and as I understand the node gets excluded.

Explain what a Smart Contract is.
Smart Contract is a program stored on the blockchain that executes once pre-agreed conditions have been met. Example: When trading nfts on Schwap.io, you first enter your address (which gets verified), pick the asset (program checks what items you own), then you enter other parties information and pick the assets to trade for (those get verified too), once all of those conditions are met the trade gets submitted to the other party. Once they agree to the conditions the trade gets submitted and added to the blockchain.

Explain the difference between a script and a transaction.
Scripts are used strictly to read the information on the blockchain, therefore are free. Purpose of a transaction is to read and add information to the blockchain which in Flow's case luckily only costs fractions of a cent.

My own observation:
Why the f has it taken humanity 20+ years to go from the concept of the blockchain to a use-case like Bitcoin, with what seems like not much inbetween? Did we have a mind-blank or something?
